        <p>Tank, any heavily armed and armoured combat vehicle that moves on two endless metal chains called tracks.
            Tanks are essentially weapons platforms that make the weapons mounted in them more effective by their
            cross-country mobility and by the protection they provide for their crews. Weapons mounted in tanks have
            ranged from single rifle-calibre machine guns to, in recent years, long-barreled guns of 120- or 125-mm
            (4.72- or 4.92-inch) calibre.</p>

        <p>Fighter aircraft are military aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air
            combat. In military conflict, the role of fighter aircraft is to establish air superiority of the
            battlespace. Domination of the airspace above a battlefield permits bombers and attack aircraft to engage in
            tactical and strategic bombing of enemy targets, and helps prevent the enemy from doing the same.
            The key performance features of a fighter include not only its firepower but also its high speed and
            maneuverability relative to the target aircraft.</p>

        <p>Aircraft carrier, naval vessel from which airplanes may take off and on which they may land. As early as
            November 1910, an American civilian pilot, Eugene Ely, flew a plane off a specially built platform on the
            deck of the U.S. cruiser Birmingham at Hampton Roads, Virginia. On January 18, 1911, in San Francisco Bay,
            Ely landed on a platform built on the quarterdeck of the battleship Pennsylvania, using wires attached to
            sandbags on the platform as arresting gear; he then took off from the same ship.

                <h1>INDIAN MILITARY FORCE</h1>
                <P>The Indian military consists of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, responsible for national defense. The
                    Army is among the largest in the world, while the Navy secures maritime interests, and the Air Force
                    handles aerial operations. It includes paramilitary forces for internal security and maintains
                    nuclear capabilities. Modernization efforts focus on indigenization through initiatives like "Make
                    in India."

                    <p>The Indian Army, established in 1895, is one of the largest standing armies in the world,
                        dedicated to defending India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. It comprises various
                        regiments and corps, including infantry, artillery, and armored units, and operates under the
                        motto "Service Before Self." The President of India is the Supreme Commander, while the Chief of
                        Army Staff is the highest-ranking officer. The army plays a vital role in UN peacekeeping
                        missions and disaster relief efforts. Rigorous training is conducted at institutions like the
                        Indian Military Academy, with a growing inclusion of women in various roles. Modernization
                        initiatives focus on advanced technology and joint exercises with other nations. Community
                        engagement through education and health initiatives is a priority. Bravery is honored through
                        awards like the Param Vir Chakra. The army actively participates in counter-terrorism operations
                        and collaborates with other branches for national security. It remains a symbol of national
                        pride and resilience.
